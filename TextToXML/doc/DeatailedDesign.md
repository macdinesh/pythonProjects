#Detailed Design

Text documents, such as tweets, are usually composed of topically coherent text data, which
within each topically coherent data, one would expect that the word usage demonstrates more
consistent lexical distributions than that across the data-set. A linear partition of texts into topic
segments can be used for text analysis tasks, such as passage retrieval in IR (information
retrieval), document summarization, recommender systems, and learning-to-rank methods.
